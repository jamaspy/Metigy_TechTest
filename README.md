## James Aspinall - Google AdWords Tech Challenge

Thank you for the chance to complete the challenge. I really enjoyed it, and learnt alot along the way.

I got the UI to work without inporting the settings state from the JSON file initially. However, when I import the JSON file and used that to set my initial state, my switches no longer work. I would LOVE you to tell me why :( It is driving me mad.

I am pleased with what I managed to produce and look forward to your feedback.

#### Many Thanks

#### James
